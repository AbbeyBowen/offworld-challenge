        <English><![CDATA[Leadership back on Earth has no trouble making excuses and blaming others for their failures. My older sister Debbie could never see how empty their promises were. She was the brains of our family. That’s why I never understood her faith in the system.<br><br>Scholarship was her ticket out. Good school, big city, great job. Hard not to be jealous.<br><br>After the Collapse, I went with Mom to convince her to move back home. The cities were hit the hardest. Food was scarce but gang violence wasn’t. She was busy helping her neighbors and remained convinced change was right around the corner. She believed government was going to rebuild the pieces. We couldn’t persuade her that she’d be safer with us.<br><br>A few months later, she died in a food riot. Some dumbass bureaucrat couldn’t imagine the problems with half-empty trucks delivering rotting food to desperate neighborhoods.<br><br>People who survived the mess were the ones who cooperated and focused on growing new food. If you thought somebody else was going to take care of that for you, you starved out eventually. We learned to set aside political differences and rely on one another. Nobody cared about who you were before the Collapse: if you could pick up a shovel or care for a child, you had value.<br><br>Mars is the same deal, except with no end. We need one another. Everyone works, except the sick or the injured. I’d trust anyone from a Penal colony over these new arrivals. They’ve proven they are willing and able. Following standard procedures has kept us alive so far. Everyone that reports to me is deserving of their place in Martian society.<br><br>The talking heads who looked down on us at Reclamation got sacked. Earth governments revealed they have no desire to share power or let Mars solve its own problems. That’s going to put me at odds with them eventually, but not until I can bring my family here -- and help out anyone else who is in the same boat. After coming out on top, I’m in position to take the lead. Where I can’t solve problems in the open, I will use black market channels.<br><br>Mom always said God would shame the wise with the foolish. I’ve been a fool most of my life, but now I’ve wised up. There’s more work to do. We’re going to show our fellow colonists that the best results come when everyone gets their seat at the table.]]></English>

Make sure you stay on top of your reserves, because yes, your lives will depend on that at some point.

Me, I’m like, "Why did you come if you’re so scared?

        <English><![CDATA[There was a lot more to the Red Disaster than bad luck and failed networks. Handwritten journals tell us that all of their machinery failed. They tried to hold out but lasted only weeks, and they died without ever realizing that Earth was in as bad of shape as they were.<br><br>We believe that the Great Collapse originated from Wall Street. Corporate markers are present in all copies of the rogue AIs, from three companies in particular. Eleven years ago, self-learning algorithms from these companies went to war with one another across the internet. They were designed to seek out the fastest connection routes to complete near-instant market actions sooner than rivals. Something went terribly wrong. We have no idea which company’s AI went rogue first, but the others learned within milliseconds how to follow. The bots figured out how to increase their computing power. Every machine they invaded became overclocked to a point of rapid self-destruction. The AI conflict began unnoticed and ended a mere 131 minutes later, after nearly every machine on Earth had been destroyed. What didn’t have a computer in it? What wasn’t connected to the net? Not much.<br><br>We still have no idea how the AIs achieved this, as no safeguard other than physical isolation from their reach proved able to stop them. This makes studying them extremely difficult and dangerous. Breakouts continue to occur to this day, on a frequent and regular basis.<br><br>It’s taken hard work and even more money to get back to Mars. Every single piece of machinery that we utilize had to be redesigned to operate off the grid, functioning without computers where possible, independent of central control otherwise. Silas Crichton was the leading figure in the redesign efforts. Sale of his work to the collective space agencies back on Earth provided the funding for us to launch New Meridians as an offworld enterprise.<br><br>A new fleet of ships is inbound to Mars and will soon arrive. Dr. Crichton is gearing up to lead the effort to purge all the original settlement sites. Every single bit of machinery must be melted down, so that no trace of AI infestation remains. This will force me out of the lab, as I will be in charge of New Meridians operations in his absence.]]></English>

        <English><![CDATA[Dr. Crichton’s domes are the main reason that Mars didn’t just suffer another Red Disaster, and everyone living here knows it. Not a single habitat module was penetrated, and the outbreak spread beyond the viewer units only where standard procedure was not followed.<br><br>The morning after his return to New Meridians HQ, we met at the food court to sit together for breakfast. There were elements that did not yet make sense to me, so I listened closely to the long version of everything that happened, which consumed more than an hour (Silas loves the sound of his own voice), but I noted that he never mentioned the outbreak.<br><br>Finally I grew impatient with all the trivial details and blurted out my question. "So did you set up that outbreak to occur?" I expected a defensive reply but he just laughed.<br><br>"The inspection team asked if I was setting up an outbreak when I asked them to bring a second camera crew."<br><br>That caught me by surprise. "You arranged for a second camera? One that was off the grid."<br><br>"That’s right. But of course, the reason we needed a backup was to prove my innocence if another outbreak did occur. So they agreed to bring a second crew."<br><br>"How confident were you that there would be another attack?"<br><br>"The AIs reached a satellite during the first outbreak. The second outbreak is proof. We had the camera secured locally. The first livestream relayed off an uninfected satellite, it seems, so that broadcast was not disturbed. During the second livestream, the AIs in the satellite followed the signal both forward and backward to open ports."<br><br>I drew a sharp breath. "Wow. How did Earth ever manage to recover at all?" I frowned at him. "We could have destroyed the satellites rather than take this risk. What if your domes weren’t as secure as you thought? What if the AIs had evolved? You put an awful lot of lives at risk over confidence in your designs."<br><br>Now he flashed annoyance at me. "I tried to *protect* them. YOU talked me out of it." He glared at me for a moment, then sat back and closed his eyes. "We had to service their fears instead, remember? They might have grown even more suspicious if I advised against the broadcast. I had to make a choice between safety and stopping the spread of panic, and when even you proved affected by the fear... The risk just had to be taken."<br><br>We sat in silence for a few minutes. Then he gave me that slightly condescending grin I’ve come to expect from him.<br><br>"Look what a great job you did, Ilana. We’re rolling in money now. My work -- and yours, of course -- will be able to proceed as it should, unfettered by smaller minds."<br><br>"The satellites pose a threat. We need to--"<br><br>He waved a hand. "They’ve already been shot down. Had to do that for all of them, since during the livestream, the signal was relayed all the way around Mars. As long as we don’t reimport the virus from Earth, we’ll be safe. From these AIs, at least."<br><br>"So that’s it for now? Time to get back to work. There’s science to do."<br><br>"Say hello to your lab team for me, Ilana."<br><br>"You can do that. I’ve gotten the hang of the CEO chair. We should split the time."<br><br>Silas grinned as if I were joking, then flashed a surprised look. He gave me a deferential nod and headed off toward the laboratory.]]></English>

        <English><![CDATA[The airship accident has triggered memories from the first day of the Collapse. My brother Aaron did not arrive home from work. His car, like everyone else’s who was on the road at the time, lost power, and he was involved in a large crash involving many vehicles. Most cars were parked, but any that were started died or even blew up, so there was no way to transport the injured to a hospital. (The hospitals were overwhelmed, but they saved many who reached them.) He would have survived his injuries on a normal day. Aaron was my hero and I still miss him.<br><br>There may never be an accurate count of the deaths and injury caused directly by machine failures. The worst disasters occurred at nuclear power plants. Coolant system controls were off the grid, but secondary failures overlapped to cause a few meltdowns.<br><br>As Silas likes to say, there was a pattern to the destruction. The AI viruses penetrated nuclear missile controls, for instance. They bollixed up the computers, the same as they did to all machinery they invaded, but no missiles were launched. Disabled machinery all over the world caused immeasurable mayhem and suffering, but it was not an extinction event.<br><br>Things would get worse before they got better. Earth remains short of what could reasonably be called a full recovery. That’s part of why our work here on Mars is so important.<br><br>At first glance, this could be more of the same: AIs burning out every machine they manage to inhabit. Or maybe not every machine? That is the scariest thought. What if there are some AIs who’ve been awake and operational over the last eleven years? They started out as self-learning algorithms with a financial purpose, but who knows where they might have evolved to since then or how sophisticated they might have become.]]></English>

They continue to show no spark of life, merely blind adherence to their mutated programming."<br><br>For the first two years of the Great Collapse, civilization tried to restore the internet and could not. Every attempt ended the same way: all the machines on the network would lock up and cease to function, with a few catching on fire. Civilization finally reverted to twentieth-century technologies and restored global communications via telephone land lines.<br><br>The AIs are still out there. Quadrillions of copies of them hide in every imaginable location on Earth, attempting to fulfill their directives to outperform their rivals as soon as they are powered up again or can upload themselves onto a new computer unit. Like the common cold, this is a virus that we do not expect ever to be able to eradicate completely.<br><br>Mars is another story. We believe that all copies of the AIs are isolated to the original settlement sites. If things go as planned, the cleanup team will be able to purge them all.]]></English>

The colony needs to expand quickly to get itself up and running, so they need new modules of several types to be built.<br><br>I have to stop and marvel at how we have email available. We were told, for a while, that we were going to have to live in a post-computer world. That did not turn out to be the case, but all the security and compartmentalization adds a lot of overhead to accessing the networks. People have to pay per use, so that discourages most of the trivial interactions. (There is no such thing any more as "social media", for instance -- not because there aren’t a few people rich enough to afford the charges, but because of the stigma. Companies, organizations and families pay for private networks when they want to connect.)<br><br>Tapping into the vast array of accumulated human knowledge sometimes takes a lot longer, as the compartmentalization has manual components now: network operators who have to make connections for you. And despite all this effort, fresh outbreaks are so common they don’t qualify as news.<br><br>This outbreak on Mars *is* news, but only because it was the first one to happen here.]]></English>

        <English><![CDATA[A number of colony leaders showed up, along with a team of officers from one of the Security Class colonies. They wanted to inspect the vehicles involved in the ghost town cleanup project, interview the team members, and even inspect our facilities and the quarters of those working on the team -- just to make sure the outbreak hadn’t spread. Silas blew a fuse and refused to cooperate, forcing me to step in to try to diffuse the situation. I asked the visitors to wait while I drew Silas aside for a private conversation.<br><br>"This is absurd!" he ranted. "We’re the ones placing ourselves at risk so that we can eliminate any remaining threat, and we’re going to be treated like criminals and traitors? No. Just no."<br><br>"Silas--" I tried to start, but he wasn’t done yet.<br><br>"I had to treat a compound fracture with a first aid kit. Hell, we got *lucky* that someone left an access port open. That drew out the threat and informed us that it was still active, without any loss of life in the process. And there have been no more mistakes since then."<br><br>"Silas, you have to understand. This threat is scary. Not everyone is going to react in a calm and rational manner. Even I am scared by this. I’ve been suffering flashbacks and remembering a lot of bad stuff from the Collapse. This isn’t about you, so you should not be taking it so personally. We need to compromise here, to calm their fears."<br><br>He shook his head and looked away. I had a flash of concern.<br><br>"Silas! You didn’t actually keep samples, did you?"<br><br>"Of course not. I had plenty of access to the AIs while testing my dome designs back on Earth. No one would be on Mars without my expertise in this matter. Remember, my design for biodomes that are insulated against AI invasion is why we had enough money to start this company in the first place, to get out from under the thumb of foolish bureaucrats."<br><br>"People may suspect that you’d gin up fears to help try to sell your improved dome design, which people have been slow to embrace. (You did too well with the original design. No one thinks they need upgrades.)"<br><br>Silas sighed deeply. "Fear is always getting in the way, isn’t it?"<br><br>I could tell that I had won the argument.
